Here's a short guide on how to chat when playing (or not) on the server. Player names When you link your Minecraft account with your Discord account, your nickname on the official Discord server is automatically changed to your in-game nickname. This makes the tagging/mentioning people very convenient no matter if you're in-game or chatting on Discord. Tagging/mentioning someone No matter if you're on Discord or in-game, you can always tag someone by typing @{in-game nickname} . On Discord, you just use the regular Discord auto-completion as you're already used to and in Minecraft you just type @{in-game nickname} which then gets automatically converted on Discord thus mentioning the person you want. Whispering/DMs/PMs On most servers you can use commands like /w or `/tell , however we prefer for majority of our communication to happen on Discord directly, so these commands are unfortunately disabled in favour of Discord. Off topic Seeing the player list on Discord If you ever find yourself wondering who's currently online, but you're not in-game, just use the command playerlist (no prefixes or suffixes) on the #minecraft-chat text channel.","title":"Chatting in-game"},{"location":"chatting-game/#chatting-in-game","text":"The in-game Minecraft chat is designed in such a way that it is a simple integration of the Discord chat in-game more than a full-fledged chatting system.
