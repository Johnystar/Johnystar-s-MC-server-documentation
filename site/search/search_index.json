Here's a short guide on how to chat no matter if you're in-game or not. Tagging/mentioning someone No matter if you're on Discord or in-game, you can always tag someone by typing @{in-game nickname} . On Discord, you just use the regular Discord auto-completion as you're already used to and in Minecraft you just type @{in-game nickname} which then gets automatically converted on Discord thus mentioning the person you want. This is really easy thanks to player name synchronisation - more details in the in-game interface section.
