# Chatting in-game

The in-game Minecraft chat is designed in such a way that it is a simple integration of the Discord chat in-game more than a full-fledged chatting system. Here's a short guide on how to chat when playing (or not) on the server.

## Player names

When you link your Minecraft account with your Discord account, your nickname on the official Discord server is automatically changed to your in-game nickname. This makes the tagging/mentioning people very convenient no matter if you're in-game or chatting on Discord.

## Tagging/mentioning someone

No matter if you're on Discord or in-game, you can always tag someone by typing ``@{in-game nickname}``. On Discord, you just use the regular Discord auto-completion as you're already used to and in Minecraft you just type ``@{in-game nickname}`` which then gets automatically converted on Discord thus mentioning the person you want.

## Whispering/DMs/PMs

On most servers you can use commands like ``/w`` or ``/tell``, however we prefer for majority of our communication to happen on Discord directly, so these commands are unfortunately disabled in favour of Discord.

### Seeing the player list on Discord

If you ever find yourself wondering who's currently online, but you're not in-game, just use the command ``playerlist`` (no prefixes or suffixes) in the ``#minecraft-chat`` text channel.
