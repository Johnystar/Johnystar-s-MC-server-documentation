# GSit

GSit is a plugin on our server that allows you to sit on chairs, benches and other comfortable places.

## Usage

Right click a chair (or other sittable object - very scientific terminology) and voil√†, you're sitting!

## Troubleshooting

If any problems occur such as you not being able to sit on a chair (a simple staircase isn't enough), then contact me (Johnystar) on Discord.
