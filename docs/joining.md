# Joining the server

## Prerequisites

**In order to be able to join and play on the server, you need all of the following:**

- a copy (official or cracked) of Minecraft Java Edition version 1.8 or newer - up to 1.14.4
- a Discord account with an email attached to it

### Minecraft client

You can connect with any vanilla or modded Minecraft client version 1.8 or higher, but only up to 1.14.4. The only officially supported version is vanilla or client-side modded 1.14.4. If you encounter bugs when connected with a different version of Minecraft, please try connecting with 1.14.4. If something goes wrong, you will only get support if you're on 1.14.4 and even then only limited suppor if you have a non-vanilla client.

In order to run the most optimal version (vanilla 1.14.4) you need:

- a system that can run Java
    - Windows (ideally Windows 10)
    - Unix-like operating systems
        - Mac OS
        - Linux (Ubuntu or Linux Mint recommended for beginners)
        - BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD)
        - other
- a Minecraft launcher
    - Mojang's official Minecraft launcher - downloadable from minecraft.net
    - MultiMC (recommended)
    - any other unofficial or even cracked launcher

### Discord

It is required for you to have a Discord account in order to play on the server. Your Discord account has to be linked before you can play. Your Discord account also needs to be associated with an email adress.

## Connecting

### First time

The first time you connect to the server, a short setup will take place before you can actually play.

1. join the official Discord server
2. launch Minecraft
3. add the Minecraft server to your Minecraft client's server list
4. connect to the Minecraft server
5. send the code, you've been given, as a DM on Discord to AuthBot as instructed by the server
6. connect to the Minecraft server again
7. register by using the ``/register {password} {password again}`` command
8. (optional) enable auto-login if you have a paid Minecraft account using the ``/premium`` command (note: you have to enter the command twice as you get a warning that you should only do this if you're using a Minecraft account that you paid for the first time)
9. done

### Joining again

1. launch Minecraft
2. connect to the Minecraft server
3. if you don't have auto-login enabled, login using the ``/login {password}`` command

## Troubleshooting

### Unlinking and relinking your Discord account

Do the following after connecting and logging on to the Minecraft server:

1. type and enter the following command: ``/discord unlink``
2. you have now been kicked and have to reconnect to the server
3. after reconnecting, send the code, you've been given, as a DM on Discord to AuthBot as instructed by the server
4. done

### Forgotten password

If you forgot your password to the Minecraft server and don't have auto-login enabled, then you need my help. Please contact me on Discord and I'll help you reset your password when I'm online.
