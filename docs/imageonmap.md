# ImageOnMap

ImageOnMap is a plugin that allows you to convert any online picture into a Minecraft map.

## Usage

### Creating a map

To create a new map, use ``/tomap {url}`` which will give you a map with the picture the URL leads to.

### Browse maps

To browse already existing maps, use the ``/maps`` command.

## Troubleshooting

Unfortunately, ImageOnMap is a plugin that I (Johnystar) don't have much experience with yet, so I'll make sure to update this page when I learn more about it. For now, if you experience any issues, make sure to contact me on Discord.
