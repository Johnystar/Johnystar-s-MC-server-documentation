# DiscordSRV

DiscordSRV adds various Discord-related functionality to our Minecraft server. I'm not gonna go over its functions here.

## Usage

### Checking linked Discord accounts

You can use the ``/discord linked`` command in-game to check your linked Discord accounts.

### Unlinking and relinking your Discord account

Do the following after connecting and logging on to the Minecraft server:

1. type and enter the following command: ``/discord unlink``
2. you have now been kicked and have to reconnect to the server
3. after reconnecting, send the code, you've been given, as a DM on Discord to AuthBot as instructed by the server
4. done

## Troubleshooting

### Have to re-link my accounts for no reason

Sometimes it can happen that after joining the server it prompts you again to link your account for no apparent reason. From my experience, this happens when you send useless messages to AuthBot on Discord, so just don't do that.
