# DiscordSRV

DiscordSRV adds various Discord-related functionality to our Minecraft server. I'm not gonna go over its functions here.

## Troubleshooting

### Have to re-link my accounts

Sometimes it can happen that after joining the server it prompts you again to link your account for no apparent reason. From my experience, this happens when you send useless messages to AuthBot on Discord, so just don't do that.
