# Moderation

This server's moderation is extremely simple: problematic player? **PERMANENT BAN**.

Here's a quote from ``#rules`` text channel on Discord:

> And just a clarification: **NO SECOND CHANCES - I'M NOT WILLING TO SPEND MY TIME MODERATING A BUNCH OF IDIOTS**

That said, I'm not gonna just ban you for no reason, I would have noone to play with if I did that, the point is that I'm not willing to spend my precious free time doing moderation. If you want to grief others' builds, spam in the chat, kill people for no reason or otherwise annoy the rest of people on the server, then go play somewhere else, nobody cares about your bullshit and nobody will care about giving you a second chance. You get one chance, just like real life and if you fuck it up, that's your problem to deal with, not my.
