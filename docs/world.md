# World

(feel free to skip this paragraph) *I would like to start by mentioning that I already got backlash in the past for not including Nether, and End and this time is no different. Unfortunately, I was unable to implement Nether and End in a reasonable way, so in order to get certain items, you have to use the trading system.*

Now let's get to the documentation part!

## Dimensions

The world has only 1 dimension and that is the overworld also reffered to as Earth as it is a 1:1000 recreation of it. You're free to live and build anywhere you want. Want Japan all to yourself? Sorry, that's already mine, but feel free to take Germany, France, England, Island... whichever country or island you want, just **please make sure to discuss it on Discord first so that no conflicts occur**.

## Claiming land

As mentioned above, you're free to claim any country, island or anything else as you wish **after discussing it with other members of the server on Discord**, however there is no build protection. This server relies on trust, but don't worry too much, in case griefers somehow get on to the server I'm fully prepared. See details in the security section.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting raided

If you're getting raided (without giving permission as dumb as that is), then contact me (Johnystar) on Discord and we'll resolve the conflict.
