# In-game user interface

## Player list

The player list has a special little quality of life feature that it doesn't on most servers and that is in-game time display. Wondering how long 'till the monsters come out? Check the player list!

Bonus tip: if you ever find yourself wondering who's currently online, but you're not in-game, just use the command ``playerlist`` (no prefixes or suffixes) in the ``#minecraft-chat`` text channel.

## Player names

One of the main reasons as to why you're forced to link your Discord account is so that all the in-game nicknames can be synced with Discord. This means that if you know what someone's called in-game, then contacting them via the in-game check or Discord is trivial and easy. More details regarding chatting in the chatting section.

## mcMMO

Our server is proud to present: mcMMO, a popular plugin that allows you to level up and get better at various things. Whenever you're leveling up a bar at the top (also known as boss bar) will show up to give you helpful information!
